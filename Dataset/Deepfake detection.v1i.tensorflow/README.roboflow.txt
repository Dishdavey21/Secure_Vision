The dataset includes 18288 images.
Deepfake-images-detection are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
